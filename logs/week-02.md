## Theme of the week

Lifetimes and move/copy semantics.

## What did I learn?

- I should understand move/copy semantics because it will help me offload work. I should trust that the classes I use have the correct move semantics, because it is easier to just call the assignment operator to initiate a copy than it is to manually call memcpy and try to figure out the underlying memory structure myself.

## What was the most difficult thing to learn?

## How does this help me get to lead C++ developer?
